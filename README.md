<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I added the ability to cancel a trip in the app</li>
  <ul>
      <li>App deletes the trip from the list</li>
      <li>App updates the header in the My Rides Screen</li>
      <li>List is updated when you delete the trip</li>
      <li>Day is deleted when all trips from the day is deleted</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Make it so that it looks nice for both light and dark mode</li>
  <ul>
    <li> making the dividers change color</li>
    <li> changing the color of the text</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Add a pop up that asks if the person is sure they want to cancel</li>
  <li>Add a Toast with a message that a trip was deleted on the rides view after the trip was deleted</li>
  <li>I would add that the trip would also be deleted from the database by using the api to post the deleted trip</li>
  <li>Add the ability to tap the start and end marker to see the location associated with it</li>
  <li>Test to make sure it would say the number of boosters when there are no riders other than ones with boosters</li>
  <li>Add indicators like a spinning wheel progress when loading and nothing is on the screen</li>
  <li>Add indicator or message when there is an error getting the data from the api<li>
</ul>
